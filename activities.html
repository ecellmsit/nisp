            with some
            big names like goldman sachs. The session began around 5:45 pm with about 50-55 participants and ended
            around 8pm.

            Mr. Razi enlightened us with his own experience by sharing his debacles giving us a realistic look into the
            world of
            entrepreneurship. He empathised with the hardship of starting a startup and helped us learn from his own
            experience.

            He addressed the new "normal" and told us about how he's contributing his bit to the society as an
            entrepreneur.
            Freebies were given to those who were interacting the most which made the session more engaging and fun.
